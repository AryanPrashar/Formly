# FORMLY.AI-mybiggestproject
Formly AI is your personal, AI-powered coach that analyzes your exercise posture in real time â€” giving instant, evidence-based feedback to improve performance, prevent injury, and adapt to your training goals.

## Day 1:
1. created the basis of the project as well as a rough plan (after working on smaller AI based projects I feel confident in working on a larger creation)
2. created basic branding as well as logo and general look of the application  <img width="1728" height="2304" alt="Add a heading" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e4d2db0-ff4e-42da-8349-25b55dfbb901" />
3. **Week 1** Plan Breakdown:
   - Working person skeleton
   - Create a basic detection for 6 simple exercises (squat, deadlift, bench/press, overhead press, push-up, plank) with a score per rep
   - Understanding of what is good form vs bad form to provide best feedback
## Day 2:
General Idea:
1. Real-time camera
2. MoveNet pose
3. The 6 basic exercises (squat, deadlift, bench/press, overhead press, push-up, plank)
4. Per-rep score
5. 1-3 short corrective cue
6. Session Log + Export
7. 3 Modes: Powerlifting / Athlete / General (for more specific niche-based feedback)
